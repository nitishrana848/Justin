        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>Ohhh ah
            Ohhh ah
            Ohhhh aaahhh</p>
        <p>You know you love me, I know you care</p>
        <p>Just shout whenever, and I'll be there</p>
        <p>You are my love, you are my heart</p>
        <p>And we will never ever ever be apart</p>
        <p>Are we an item? Girl, quit playing</p>
        <p>We're just friends, what are you saying?</p>
        <p>Said there's another and looked right in my eyes
        </p>
        <p>My first love broke my heart for the first time</p>
        <p>And I was like...</p>
        <p>Baby, baby, baby oooh</p>
        <p>Like baby, baby, baby nooo</p>
        <p>Like baby, baby, baby oooh</p>
        <p>I thought you'd always be mine (mine)</p>
        <p>Baby, baby, baby oooh</p>
        <p>Like baby, baby, baby nooo</p>
        <p>I thought you'd always be mine (mine)</p>
        <p>Oh, for you I would have done whatever</p>
        <p>And I just can't believe we ain't together</p>
        <p>And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you</p>
        <p>I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring</p>
        <p>And I'm in pieces, baby fix me</p>
        <p>And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream</p>
        <p>I'm going down, down, down, down</p>
        <p>And I just can't believe my first love won't be around</p>
        <p>And I'm like</p>
        <p>Baby, baby, baby oooh
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo</p>
        <p>Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love</p>
        <p>There was nobody that compared to my baby</p>
        <p>And nobody came between us or could ever come above</p>
        <p>She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck</p>
        <p>She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks</p>
        <p>She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and</p>
        <p>At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend</p>
        <p>She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing</p>
        <p>And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...</p>
        <p>Baby, baby, baby oooh
            Like baby, baby, baby nooo</p>
        <p>Like baby, baby, baby oooh
            I thought you'd always be mine (mine)</p>
        <p>I'm gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)</p>
